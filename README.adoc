= FPGA Adventures with RISC-V
Curt Brune <curt@brune.net>

This represents my wanderings with FPGAs, open source tooling, RISC-V,
compilers, and embedded software.

Wish me luck.

== Hardware

I'm using a ULXS3 with the Latice ECP5 85F FPGA
https://www.crowdsupply.com/radiona/ulx3s

== Leveraging Projects

There is a crap ton of tooling and software to install.

The gateway to the universe is the awesome
https://github.com/litex-hub/linux-on-litex-vexriscv[linux-on-litex-vexriscv]
project.  Read that first.

The install and build instructions for most projects are great, but
I've found it often necessary to build from the master branch of the
various tools for things to work.  YMMV.

I'm not going to document how to download, build, and install the
various tools.  At the end of the day I source a shell fragment to set
some environment variables... It feels like the '80s.

After building and installing everything all I do is source
`fpga-dev.sh` to set up the environment.

Things I need:

- https://github.com/litex-hub/linux-on-litex-vexriscv
- https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys
- https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr
- https://github.com/YosysHQ/prjtrellis
- https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL
- https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv
- http://git.veripool.org/git/verilator

I installed everything under a directory pointed to by
`$FPGA_TOOLS_DIR`.  Then you can just add `${FPGA_TOOLS_DIR}/bin` to
your `$PATH`.

== Run the simulation with linux-on-litex-vexriscv
```
$ cd linux-on-litex-vexriscv
$ ./sim.py
```

Be patient.  The simulation is a bit slow and it takes a while
(several minutes) to boot all the way to the Linux prompt.
Decompressing the initramfs takes awhile.

Opened issue
https://github.com/litex-hub/linux-on-litex-vexriscv/issues/258 as the
sim was hanging.  It only seems to hang as the early console was not
working with the
https://github.com/litex-hub/linux-on-litex-vexriscv/issues/164[older
pre-built Linux images].

That led me to make a couple PRs to make the simulation use the SBI
method for the earlyconsole:

- https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/pull/1145
- https://github.com/litex-hub/linux-on-litex-vexriscv/pull/260

But those ideas were bandaids, not addressing the real problem.
Ultimately I closed those PRs in favor of investigating why early
console was not working.

In the end it turned out the pre-built kernel images were out of date.
Following the
https://github.com/litex-hub/linux-on-litex-vexriscv#generating-the-linux-binaries-optional[Litex
buildroot instructions] it was straightforward to build a more recent
Linux kernel.  With that the simulation early console worked fine.

== Building the bitream for the ULXS3 with linux-on-litex-vexriscv

```
$ ./make.py --board=ulx3s --device=LFE5U-85F --cpu-count=1 --build
```

Note: The tool will not meet timing with `--cpu-count=2`.  With
`--cpu-count=1` the timing results are:

```
Info: Max frequency for clock '$glbnet$main_ecp5pll0_clkout0': 50.71 MHz (PASS at 50.00 MHz)
Info: Max frequency for clock              '$glbnet$hdmi_clk': 116.09 MHz (PASS at 25.00 MHz)
Info: Max frequency for clock            '$glbnet$hdmi5x_clk': 137.32 MHz (PASS at 125.00 MHz)
```

While with `--cpu-count=2` the timing results are:
```
Warning: Max frequency for clock '$glbnet$main_ecp5pll0_clkout0': 48.92 MHz (FAIL at 50.00 MHz)
Info: Max frequency for clock              '$glbnet$hdmi_clk': 132.73 MHz (PASS at 25.00 MHz)
Warning: Max frequency for clock            '$glbnet$hdmi5x_clk': 105.88 MHz (FAIL at 125.00 MHz)
```

== Load the FPGA bitream for the ULXS3 with linux-on-litex-vexriscv

```
$ ./make.py --board=ulx3s --device=LFE5U-85F --cpu-count=1 --load
```

`make.py` was looking for `ujprog` to load the bitstream, but it seems
`fujprog` has superceeded this program.  The command line options look
more or less the same so I symlinked `ujprog` to `fujprog`.  Seems to
work.

== Load the Linux image and rootfs

```
$ lxterm --images=images/boot.json --speed 1e6 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

The board had quickly booted to the Litex boot loader.  In order to
kick the loading over serial into action need to press `[ENTER]` and
get to the boot loader prompt and run `reboot`:

```
[ENTER]
litex>
litex> reboot

== Using picocom

I have used picocom for years.  I like it for the reason described in
the https://linux.die.net/man/8/picocom[man page], `minimal
dumb-terminal emulation program`.

```
$ picocom --baud 1000000 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

== Where is the Litex bootloader source ?

As an old u-boot guy I have a morbid curiousity about boot loaders.
The Litex project contains a little boot loader, called the `bios`.
The source for the boot loader is
https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/tree/master/litex/soc/software/bios[here].

== Issues with SDCARD

https://github.com/litex-hub/linux-on-litex-vexriscv/issues/203

The board has no "card detect (CD)" pin, so the base mmc Linux driver
goes in circles.  Slows everything down.

No fun.

=== Trying spisdcard support instead

Change `sdcard` to `spisdcard` in `make.py` for the ULX3S.  It
definitely changes the .dts file to reflect the spisdcard support.

With that change it works alright:
```
[   21.737224] Run /init as init process
[   21.752484] mmc0: error -110 whilst initialising SD card
[   23.042254] mmc0: error -110 whilst initialising SD card
[   24.518415] mmc0: host does not support reading read-only switch, assuming write-enable
[   24.526535] mmc0: new SDHC card on SPI
[   24.673222] mmcblk0: mmc0:0000 EB1QT 29.8 GiB
[   25.150765]  mmcblk0: p1

root@buildroot:~# mkdir /mnt/sd
root@buildroot:~# mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/sd
```

Made a
https://github.com/litex-hub/linux-on-litex-vexriscv/issues/258[PR for
this change].

=== Something with the SDCard is flaky....

Sometimes the SDcard would not work.  I found if I disabled
framebuffer support, the SoC was simpler, met all timing without
warnings, and the sdcard worked reliably.

Since I'm not planning to use a framebuffer, seems OK to leave that
disabled for now.

With framebuffer support enabled, the mmc driver is flaky.
```
Info: Max frequency for clock '$glbnet$main_ecp5pll0_clkout0': 51.16 MHz (PASS at 50.00 MHz)
Info: Max frequency for clock              '$glbnet$hdmi_clk': 129.37 MHz (PASS at 25.00 MHz)
Warning: Max frequency for clock            '$glbnet$hdmi5x_clk': 98.15 MHz (FAIL at 125.00 MHz)
```

With framebuffer disabled, mmc works OK.  Also no warnings.
```
Info: Max frequency for clock '$glbnet$main_crg_clkout0': 51.29 MHz (PASS at 50.00 MHz)
```

== How Does VecRiscv fit in with linux-on-litex-vexriscv

I was curious how `make.py` selected the verilog bit stream from the
https://github.com/litex-hub/pythondata-cpu-vexriscv_smp[pythondata-cpu-vexriscv-smp]
project.  Based on the various options for core (bus widths, cache
sizes, number of cores, etc...) the program uses the `VexRiscv`
project to generate the verilog for the configuration.

The project maintains a specific branch of `VexRiscv` as a git
sub-module located in
`pythondata-cpu-vexriscv-smp/pythondata_cpu_vexriscv_smp/verilog/ext/VexRiscv`.

The simple `make.py` invocation I use above turns into the following,
within the VexRiscv project directory:

```shell
$ ARGS="
--cpu-count=1
--ibus-width=32
--dbus-width=32
--dcache-size=4096
--icache-size=4096
--dcache-ways=1
--icache-ways=1
--litedram-width=16
--aes-instruction=False
--out-of-order-decoder=True
--wishbone-memory=True
--fpu=False
--cpu-per-fpu=4
--rvc=False
--netlist-name=VexRiscvLitexSmpCluster_Cc1_Iw32Is4096Iy1_Dw32Ds4096Dy1_ITs4DTs4_Ood_Wm
--netlist-directory=$OUTPUT_DIR
--dtlb-size=4
--itlb-size=4
"

$ sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.smp.VexRiscvLitexSmpClusterCmdGen $ARGS"
```

=== cleaning with sbt

Having never used `sbt` before, I need to learn the equivalent of `make clean`:

```
$ sbt clean reload
```

== Util

Every software project seems to have a directory or file called
`util`, a place to put some odds and ends.  As long as this does not
become too large, this is fine.

=== Device Tree Overlays

I wanted to fiddle with the sdcard clock frequencies at run time,
which led me to wanting Device Tree Overlays.  For a quick overview
check out https://www.digi.com/resources/examples-guides/use-device-tree-overlays-to-patch-your-device-tree[this article].

=== How to Change the Core SoC Clock Frequency

Some other issues mentioned changing the SoC clock frequency, so I
wanted to try that out.  A minor change in `make.py` for ULX3S is all
it takes -- Set `sys_clk_freq` in the `soc_kwargs` variable for the
ULX3S.

See also https://github.com/litex-hub/litex-boards/blob/master/litex_boards/targets/radiona_ulx3s.py[litex-boards/litex_boards/targets/radiona_ulx3s.py].

== Tooling

This section is a collection of notes about installing the required
software tools.

=== Verilator

Verilator is a Verilog/SystemVerilog simulator.

I installed the `stable` tag, with this git ref:
```
commit 141c5da3f9f41b17b7f984a50abe244785b823bd
Merge: 0185ee5df335 935032366fac
Author: Wilson Snyder <wsnyder@wsnyder.org>
Date:   Sun Dec 5 11:15:32 2021 -0500

    Merge from master for release.
```

=== yosys

yosys is an open sysnthesis suite and framework for RTL synthesis
tools.

```
$ make config-gcc
$ make -j$(nproc)
$ PREFIX=$FPGA_TOOLS_DIR make install
```

=== iverilog

iverilog (Icarus Verilog) is a Verilog simulation and synthesis tool.

For giggles I install this also as `make test` for yosys required it.
It follows the usual `autoconf`, `configure`, `make`, `make install`
pattern.

=== prjtrellis

Project Trellis enables a fully open-source flow for ECP5 FPGAs using
Yosys for Verilog synthesis and nextpnr for place and route.


```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$FPGA_TOOLS_DIR .
$ make -j$(nproc)
$ make install
```

=== nextpnr

nextpnr aims to be a vendor neutral, timing driven, FOSS FPGA place
and route tool.

The ULX3S has a `ecp5` part on it, so include that architecture when
building.

```
$ cmake -DARCH=ecp5 -DTRELLIS_INSTALL_PREFIX=$FPGA_TOOLS_DIR -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$FPGA_TOOLS_DIR .
$ make -j$(nproc)
$ make install
```

=== sbt -- Scala Build Tool

Need this to generate the RISC-V verilog from the VexRiscv project, so
installed it.
